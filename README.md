# UF# Module 11 Challenge - UFOs
Create an HTML for UFOs Sightings using JavaScript 

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- I need to help Dana’s webpage to ensure her dynamic table is working as intended. 
- I will provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 
- In addition to the date, I’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
1. When first opening the table there will be a list of results already working in the webpage even before filtering.
- The web page is already appealing and the formats, coloring, and the image on the background are working properly.

2. We can see the new filter additions besides the date filter:
a) City

3. We can now filter on specific criteria, in the following example I a using all the filters available:
a) Date = 1/2/2010
b) City = Atlanta
c) State = GA
d) Country = US
e) Shape = Fireball

4. You can use whatever filter you want, there is no need to fill them all up. 
- Remember that when we click on the left top corner "UFO Sightings" we will be redirected to the main web page containing pre-existing filters.

a) In the following example I only used two filter criteria:
    i) State = CA
    ii) Shape = Light
